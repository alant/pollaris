Because of how the Phaser.JS library handles files, you need to be running a web server locally to view a working copy of this project. You can't just open the index.html file in your web browser as you might a basic HTML page. 

The Web Server for Chrome(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) is an easy-to-install extension for Chrome that lets you select a folder on your computer (like the folder with the game files in them) and deliver them through a basic web server.
